# Tidesage
Tidesages are are masters of the primal elements of air and water. Initially formed by a group of humans who 2,700 years ago, left their homes and took to the ocean. They scanned the horizon day and night for a new home, seeking a place that married land and sea to shelter their children from the ocean waves. Their leader was the first to hear the whispers of the Tidemother, gentle and imperceptible to all but her, which taught her the power of the seas. Thier powers guided fish and fresh water to the sailors, now masters of the elements, and as thier powers grew others began to hear the Tidemother. The wind was theirs to command as it powered their sails, and the hulls of their ships became impenetrable to the denizens of the ocean deeps. The sea guided the sailors to a new home, an island that they would call the Isle of Whispers, and they sent their tidesages to guide others of all creeds to come to the island as well.

### Masters of the Wind and the Waves
The magic granted to the tidesages by the Tidemother allows for control over the immense powers of the Ocean and the Skies.  

This power is not granted at birth, but rather training along with an extensive period of life on the open ocean allows willing accolytes to hear the wispers of the Tidemother and harness the powers granted by her.

The gifts cranted allow tidesages to propel ships to unnatural speeds by harnessing the wind to blow the sales or guiding the water to flow effortlessly over the hull. They can also harness these powers for combat, buffeting thier foes with unnatural storms and washing them away with powerful blasts of water.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells

The Tidesage table shows how many Spell Slots you have to cast your Spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these Spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended Spell Slots when you finish a Long Rest.

You prepare the list of Tidesage Spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of Tidesage Spells from your Scrollbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your Tidesage level (minimum of one spell). The Spells must be of a level for which you have Spell Slots.

You can change your list of prepared Spells when you finish a Long Rest. Preparing a new list of Tidesage Spells requires time spent studying your Scrollbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per Spell Level for each spell on your list.
